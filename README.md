# Naive-Bayes-Project
Naive Bayes project for my CS-5333 Machine Learning course. Implements two versions of Naive Bayes for the purposes of user review sentiment classification and hand-written digit recognition.

Data files for text classification are included in the 'data' folder. This data comes from UC-Irvine's Machine Learning Repository, the 'Sentiment Labeled Sentences' dataset. Can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences

The dataset for digit recognition can be found at the MNIST website: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
